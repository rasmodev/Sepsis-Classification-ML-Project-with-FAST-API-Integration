# Project Overview:
**i. Data Collection and Preprocessing:** I loaded and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset containing clinical and physiological data from patients to train and evaluate the sepsis classification model.

**ii. Machine Learning Model:** I implemented a state-of-the-art machine learning model tailored for sepsis classification. This model has been fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in detecting sepsis early, which is crucial for timely intervention.

**iii. FAST API Integration:** I've seamlessly integrated the trained machine learning model into a web application using FAST API. This web application allows healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive instant predictions regarding sepsis risk.

**iv. Usage and Deployment:** In this README file, you will find detailed instructions on how to use and deploy this web application, making it user-friendly for both developers and healthcare practitioners.

# How to Use:
